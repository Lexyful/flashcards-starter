Abstract:
The application is a flashcards game. It's a great way for someone in coding school to study their knowlege of coding. The user will be presented with a question and three possible answers in the command line and a series of  questions will appear. After they've selected their anwer, a message will appear giving them the feedback of 'correct!' or 'incorrect' and the percentage of how many questions they've answered correctly.

Installation Instructions:
Open up the terminal and paste the SSH code after typing git clone in the terminal. Next enter the repesitory with the cd command. Then type code . and the code will come up in the text editer. Then in the terminal type node index.js and the application will open in the browser.

Learning Goals:
The goal i s to demonstrate what I've learned up to this point. Specifically showing how to demonstrate proper use of ES6 classes. Insure that I am using the single responsibility principle when writing code. Implement a test suite using TDD.

Wins + Challenges:
A win during this project was implementing class to class interaction. That was really tricky just a few weeks ago, and alough it's a tricky process to set up it, it came much easier to me this week. Another win is that I was able to be a bit more resourceful during this project. I'm getting better at knowing what to search when I google using what I find write my code, and my debugging has come a long way. This was a challenging project for me, getting my class files set up was a really tough challenge especially now that the specs are getting less specific. But it challened me to think more like a developer and less like a student. I struggled to complete this project. I was stuck for a really long time on round, and I should have reached out for help a little sooner. I didn't complete my Game test or my Deck test, and that was disappointing. I am proud of what I've accomplished but my goal was to complete the project. I'm glad I was able to learn to productively struggle before reaching out for help to soon, but I do think I held out a little too long on that.
